<h2><strong>User Management</strong></h2>
<p>User management is one of the most importnat roles that a system administrator fulfills. With my experience from working in the IT department at CSUN, we commonly handle a variety of tasks which pertain to this. Primarily - creating new accounts (portal, canvas, and email) for new students, changing passwords, deleting users, and many other configurations per student. In a file style, there are sets of permissions organized into 3 classes: user, group, and others.</p>

<p>In today's blog, I will be discussing the different ways to manage users.</p>

<h2><strong>List of Commands</strong></h2>
<ul>

<li><p><b>Adduser</b>: This command adds a single user.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Newusers</b>: Creates several new users from a textfile</p></li>
<li><p><b>Deluser</b>: This is used to delete a user</p></li>
<li><p><b>Addgroup</b>: Adds a user to a group or system</p></li>
<li><p><b>Delgroup</b>: removes user from a group or system</p></li>
<li><p><b>Chage</b>: This is used to manage the user's password</p></li>

</ul>

<h2><strong>Important Files</strong></h2>

<p>There are 3 main files I will be discussing:</p>

<p>
<b>/etc/passwd</b>: /etc/passwd is a text file which contains attributes about each user on a system. Each line that exists within /etc/passwd represents a single user, where the first will be listed as root (for administrative). By default, the permissions set for this file is <i>readable</i> so that anyone on the system can read it. Every line contains 7 attributes: <i>name, password, user ID, group ID, gecos, home directory,</i> and <i>shell</i>.
</p>

<p>
<b>/etc/group</b>: /etc/group is a text file which defines the groups to which users belong under. Within Unix/Linux operating systems, multiple users can be categorized into groups. This file corresponds directly with /etc/passwd when a new user is added. If the group name is not defined for a user, then a new group name will be automatically created to be the same as the username. 
</p>

<p>
<b>/etc/shadow</b>: /etc/shadow is a file that actually stores passwords in an encrypted format for a user's account with additional properties such as the salt, checksum, and more. In other words, the purpose of the /etc/shadow file is to store secure user account information. Every line in /etc/shadow has 8 fields: <i>1. Username, 2. Password, 3. Date of last password change, 4. Minimum, 5. Maximum, 6. Warn, 7. Inactive</i> and <i>8. Expiration</i>.
</p>
