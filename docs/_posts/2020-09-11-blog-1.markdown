<p>In CIT 384, we learned a lot of different types of HTML tags to further assist the developer in creating a more semantic structure to format the page for greater accessibility. By having a more consistent, semantic structure, the website will prove to be more effective in illustrating the content on each page. The ones I will be talking about for this blog will be described below, called <strong>sectioning elements</strong>. The sectioning element tags we utilized for our labs were <i>header, nav, main, article, section, aside,</i> and <i>footer</i> to allow authors to identify commonality across the different pages. </p>

<p>The &lt;header&gt;</p>

<p>The &lt;main&gt;</p>

<p>The &lt;nav&gt;</p>

<p>The &lt;section&gt;</p>

<p>The &lt;aside&gt;</p>

<p>The &lt;article&gt; </p>
